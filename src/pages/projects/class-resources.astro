### Purpose and Goal

As a university student a common problem faced while exam night study was that we couldn't find the
lecture slides and other class resources. So, I decided to create an application using where we can
find all the class resources at one place. So, I just sat down one weekend and developed a web
application using angular. And, I never thought this
[one weekend side project](https://github.com/nmanumr/fa18-bcs-c/tree/e875cb6c5e375d3994bfd548d02d3561aa1dc9a0)
will actually be very helpful and boy did this helped.

### Some goodies

* With firebase local data presistence and a service worker the app could work offline too.
Although user can't download resources but, they can see the list even without internet connection.
* The app layout adopts between mobile and desktop browsers. On mobile devices it starts to behaviour
like regular mobile app and can be added to home screen (thanks to a manifest file and a service worker).
I also created an andriod app using Ionic framework, but for some reason the overall exeprince was
little laggy.
* Dark mode was supported, and I guess this was the very first time I implemented a dark mode in any
of the application.

### Lesons Learnt

This was probably my first developed app with some real users, so I had some sort of pressure to
maintain the project after its development so on this road I learnt a lesson hard way that sometime
the maintaince of a project can become much harder that actual development.

### Purpose and Goal

The initial class resources version was quite successful in a way that my fellows found it really
useful and it was serving its purpose quite well. But, eventhough everyone really liked the web app
the mobile app wasn't that great and was quite laggy. So, I decided to redesign the mobile app in
next semester break.

My idea was that I'm going redesign the app that will not only work for my
class but also for everyone othe class in the university and lunching it in the start of semester
will also be a great idea, right? yeah not completely, the only thing I didn't knew that the problem
also scale exponentially with userbase and features. But, first lets talk about what I was able to
accomplish.

### New Features
* Now, students can have a personlized experince by logging in to the app. They will only be
presented with the only subjects they are enrolled in and also they can add or remove different course if
they want.
* CRs could maintain the resourse of there respective classes.
* Along with class resources students could also receive notifications from CR and he can also add
tasks/events like assignments, quizzes etc.
* Students could see their timetable easily from homescreen (without opening the app) with a
homescreen widget.

### Issues Faced
* The first and foremost issue was about maintaining the resources. Previously I myself volunteered
to add resources like lectures slides, text books etc. But, now I wanted the CRs to do so who were
quite lazy enough the do so.
* When @ameerhmzx and I added the homescreen widget to the app, for some unexpected reasons app
started to crash randomly and frequently, thankfully we haven't annouced our app publically and the
only users we had were our class fellows.
* The scaling issues hitted us the most, our app could work quite good for lets say a single
class but I wasn't scaling well which thankfully we realized quite early.
* On top of everything, it was my first time I ever developed an andriod app and, not to mention with,
a framework named Flutter that is just released now.

And there were alot of other issues too but all in all the app had really cool features everyone
liked them but we had alot of internal issues that we just couldn't maintaint this app.

### Lessons Learnt
With this project I could easily add a new course to my degree "How Not to Start a New Project".

<div class="text-sm">\* **Why its not PlayStore's link?** This was one of many issues happened with
this project, we lost our playstore account.</div>

### Purpose and Goal

After the failure of mobile app I thought it would be a great if I can develop a web app first
and then after making it rock solid we can utilize our lesson we learnt in previous attempt to
develop a better mobile app next time or may be just fix the existing app.

    collabrators={['ibtashamalee', 'lablnet']}

### Purpose and Goal

At this point I already lost intreset in the project because due to covid19 the whole teaching
had been shifted platforms like Google Classroom and Microsoft Teams where teachers them selfs were
taking care of organizing the class resources (which I always wanted).
The only features I really missed was timetable on homescreen, which I'm, at the time of writing,
planning to create a seperate app. So, I decided to do for just last time. Also, I just had been
tired of angular and material design so basically it was just a redesign.

### Some Goodies

* Although I haven't done alot in this project but this was my first properly design project
and I liked how the design part of this project turned out.
* I also managed to add some admin features like adding resources etc.

### Leasons Learnt
Although there isn't much to say about this project but I learnt few new technologies quite level in
during this project like Vuejs &amp; TailwindCSS (which I still I love with).
